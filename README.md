### Configuration
All the **configuration** of the application has been **externalized** to the code itself so that you can modify it to your liking in the simplest way possible.

You can see the default configuration in the `CONFIG.json` file.

You can modify this configuration to your liking, for example to change the width of the tiles or the color of the walls.

#### Adding walls
You can also add walls to the game. Just go to the `/walls/walls` configuration file section and you will see a list of values with this syntax.
```
[
  [[a1, b1], [c1, d1]],
  [[a2, b2], [c2, d2]],
  ...
  [[aN, bN], [cN, dN]]
]
```
These lists represent Cartesian coordinates, in a plane a segment has a start point and an end point. **This two points can be seen as** `a & b`where `a = {x1, y1}` and `b = {x2, y2}`. **So the wall segments are determined in the form of**:
```
[
  [[x1, y1], [x2, y2]]
]
```

###### Segment in a full cartesian plane

In our game we **consider that** `{a, b} âˆˆ N`.

### About RayCasting

The so-called RayCasting is a technique designed to **solve multiple problems in ray tracing to an object by simulating natural light rays**. In RayCasting a ray is traced from a point `a` to a point `a + 1` as long as this ray does not collide with any obstacle.

Taking this into account, we can launch rays that advance in a certain direction. These rays will never stop moving unless they hit an obstacle.

Techniques as complex as Envidia RTX can be simplified to the maximum with a two-dimensional demonstration like the one in this repository. After all, Ray tracing is based on bouncing light rays with the most light-like properties possible against solid objects.

<p align="center"><img src="images/rtx-explication.png" alt="..."></p>

When a casting beam detects an obstacle, it can **produce a signal**, this could be used for countless purposes such as improving the physics of a simulator or even improving the layout of lasers in a game. The possibilities are endless. To check the distance of the ray to an object, you can use **any mathematical equation**. In this project we use the **Euclidean distance** formula to calculate the distance.
